# Problem 8
Write a program that prints _all_ prime numbers.

Addendum, there is an infinite number of primes, as written this program is de facto impossible.
Further, there are no simple, non-intensive formula that effectively calculate _all_ primes between two points that I am aware of.
As such I am going for an intentionally non-optimal solution then moving on to the next problem.
