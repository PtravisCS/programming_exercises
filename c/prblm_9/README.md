# Problem 9
Write a guessing game where the user has to guess a secret number. 
After every guess the program should tell the user whether their number was too large or too small. 
At the end of the game the number of tries needed to guess the number correctly should be printed. 
It should only count as one try if the user inputs the same number multiple times consecutively.
